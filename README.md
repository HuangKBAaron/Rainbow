Rainbow
=======

A small rainbow table generator and reverse hash lookup program. The program will create the tables as cPickle files.

For details on the alphabets and hashes supported, type in `help(function)`. 

**To-do:** 
- Major rewrite json or SQLite3 support for extended databases
- More documentation
- Actually use rainbow tables/chaining and not just a lookup table

Alternate names: Need Hash Now, Rainbow Hash
